## To add your code follow these steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sahilvirdi01/cpp-programming.git
cd cpp-programming/
```
### 2. Make a new git branch
Create a new branch of your name to keep the code and history clean. 
```bash
git checkout -b <your-name>
#This will create a new branch and automatically switch to it
```
 - replace your-name with your actual name to create a new branch
### 3. Add your code 
```bash
cd codes/
#Add your code to this folder
```
### 4. Stage and commit changes
```bash
git add <filename>
#OR
git add .
git commit -m "Added <filename.cpp>"
```
### 5. Push the branch
```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```
 - replace the branch-name wth name of your branch you just created.

### 6. Create a pull request on Github
#### Github --> Compare & Pull Request --> Merge after review
